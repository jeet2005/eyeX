# Eye-X System Walkthrough 🚀

Welcome to **Eye-X**, the next-generation Smart Attendance & Behavioral Analytics system designed for modern educational institutions.

## 1. Core Features 🌟

- **Zero-Touch Attendance:** Uses Face Recognition (YuNet) to mark attendance instantly.
- **Behavioral Intelligence:** Tracks student attention (Focused, Distracted, Sleeping) using Head Pose Estimation.
- **Edge-First Architecture:** Processes video on the device, saving 95% bandwidth and ensuring privacy.
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** Low-latency (<200ms) WebRTC streaming for live classroom monitoring.

## 2. User Journey 🗺️

### A. The Landing Page (`/`)
The entry point to the system.
- **Hero Section:** Features a stunning "Gradient Mesh" animation.
- **Feature Grid:** Highlights the "Privacy First" and "Edge Computing" approach.
- **Navigation:** Quick links to the Dashboard and Project Documentation.

### B. The Live Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
The command center for administrators.
- **Smart Cards:** Shows Total Students, Present, and Absent counts in real-time.
- **Camera Feeds:**
    - **Gate Camera:** Monitors entry/exit for attendance.
    - **Classroom Camera:** Takes periodic snapshots for behavior analysis.
- **Visual Feedback:**
    - **Pulse Animation:** Indicates when a camera is offline or waiting for a signal.
    - **Live Bounding Boxes:** Draws green boxes for recognized faces and colored boxes for behavior states.

### C. Engineering Deep-Dive (`/project`)
A "Research-Grade" documentation page.
- **Interactive Charts:** 8+ dynamic charts visualizing Network Latency, AI Accuracy, and Database Throughput.
- **Architecture Diagrams:** Explains the WebRTC + DTLS handshake and Data Flow.
- **Code Snippets:** Displays the actual Python logic for Vector Matching and Head Pose Math.

### D. Mobile Clients (`/gate`, `/classroom`)
The "Edge Nodes". Open these on any smartphone to turn it into an AI Camera.
- **Gate Mode:** Optimized for continuous face scanning.
- **Classroom Mode:** Optimized for high-res snapshots every 10 seconds.

## 3. Technology Stack 🛠️

- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI/Quart), WebSockets.
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), JavaScript (ES6+).
- **AI Core:** OpenCV, YuNet (Face), ResNet (Features), PnP Solver (Pose).
- **Database:** MongoDB (Time-Series Collections).
- **Protocol:** WebRTC (Peer-to-Peer Video), DTLS-SRTP (Encryption).

## 4. Setup Guide 📦

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Access the System:**
   - **Dashboard:** `http://localhost:8000/dashboard`
   - **Gate Camera:** `http://localhost:8000/gate` (Open on Phone)
   - **Classroom Camera:** `http://localhost:8000/classroom` (Open on Phone)

## 5. Troubleshooting 🔧

- **"Signal Lost":** Ensure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network (for WebRTC LAN access).
- **"Camera Permission Denied":** Allow browser camera access on the mobile device.
- **Low FPS:** The system automatically drops frames if CPU usage exceeds 90%.
